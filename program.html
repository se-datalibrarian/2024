<h2>2024 Keynote</h2>
	<p>We are so excited to announce our 2024 Keynote Speaker, Dr. Michelle Hribar!</p>

	<div style="text-align:center; width:100%><img src="SEDLS_2024_keynote.png" alt="2024 keynote announncement flyer"></div>

	<p><em>Keynote Title:</em> Big Data Projects at the NIH: Report from an NIH DATA Scholar</p>
 
<p><em>Abstract:</em> Access to large, diverse datasets is key for the development of AI models in biomedicine. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) recognizes this need and has several ongoing efforts to increase access to data for researchers: establishing data generation projects such as Bridge2AI and All of Us, promoting access to observational health data stored in electronic health records, and encouraging data sharing. All of these efforts require data standardization, which is currently an important focus of the NIH; common data models and common data elements (CDEs) are a few example approaches for improving data standardization and data sharing.</p>
 
<p>The NIH started the Data and Technology Advancement (DATA) National Service Scholar Program in 2020 to help with large data science projects across the NIH. I served as a DATA Scholar at the National Eye Institute from 2022 â€“ 2024, focusing on standardizing ocular observational health data into the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model. This talk will discuss my DATA scholar project within the larger context of data science and standardization projects at the NIH.</p>
 
<p><em>Bio:</em> Dr. Michelle R. Hribar, PhD is an Associate Professor of Ophthalmology and Medical Informatics at Oregon Health & Science University. She was also very recently an NIH DATA Scholar at the National Eye Institute (NEI) where she worked in the Office of Data Science and Health Informatics. She is currently leading a national effort to improve the standardization of ophthalmic data for research, which includes co-chairing the Observational Health and Data Science Informatics (OHDSI) Eye Care and Vision Research workgroup with the goal of adding ophthalmic data to the OMOP common data model. Dr. Hribar originally trained as a computer scientist before retraining as a medical informaticist at Oregon Health & Science University. Her NIH grant funded research has focused exclusively on informatics in ophthalmology, specifically in the reuse of electronic health record data for research both in operations and clinical applications.

Academic librarians have a distinct role in teaching data literacy to prepare students for the workforce. While student self-perception of their data literacy has been studied, limited research has investigated professionals with regards to using data literacy skills in practice.  This poster shares initial findings from a research survey examining how business data literacy competencies align with professional workplace practices. The presenters surveyed professionals within the supply chain and logistics industries, seeking information on their levels of data literacy, in what ways data literacy competencies are reflected in their work, and how they developed the data literacy skills required for their job. The findings help demonstrate how business data literacy competencies resonate from classroom to workplace and provide further context for teaching data literacy along with information literacy.<br /><br /><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> <ul class="vertical-list"><li>Attendees will be able to recognize the business data literacy competencies. <li>Attendees will be able to describe how surveyed workers rate their data literacy skills. <li>Attendees will be able to explain the value of librarians' role in teaching data literacy for workforce preparation. </ul></div></td></tr>

This talk will describe a pilot program for participants who had previously taken a Library Carpentry workshop to develop confidence and skills in R programming. In this session, we will discuss the considerations that went into developing the structure of the program, lessons learned from the experience, and plans for continuation and future directions. <br><br>This experience was designed to cultivate a sense of community for data-minded information professionals around developing new skills and their practical application. Over 6 live sessions, we explored new skills in R, for example, data visualization, restructuring datasets, and communicating with Quarto. Participants were also encouraged to work on their own data throughout the class. Time was allocated in each session for participants to ask questions and get feedback in a supportive, collaborative learning environment.  <br /><br /><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> <ul class="vertical-list"><li> Explore the challenges of transferring skills from one-shot Carpentries-type training to using programming day to day<li>How to increase learner confidence in programming skills through practical application<li>Demonstrate relevance of R programming to librarianship </ul></div>

Data librarians possess much of the knowledge and skills necessary to assist researchers throughout the lifecycle of their projects, providing assistance on everything from data management and sharing plans to the eventual archival of various research products. However, librarians and researchers do not always speak the same language or prioritize the same outcomes for research products. As someone nearing the completion of a Ph.D. in biology and serving as a Research Data Specialist in an academic library, I can contribute perspectives as both a researcher and research support staff. Using my own personal experience as well as evidence from empirical research, I will discuss problematic divides and promising overlaps between researchers and data librarians and recommend strategies for more effective cooperation between these two groups. <br /><br /><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> <ul class="vertical-list"><li>Attendees will be able to assess the relationship between librarians and researchers at their institution and implement manageable changes to improve that relationship. <li>Attendees will be able to evaluate how their current research support services and priorities might align or conflict with the needs and wants of researchers.</ul></div>

In this talk, I will delve into the successes and challenges encountered in this BIPOC-centered data services training. By thoroughly examining the experiences of this internship and the program's impact, I will explore its contributions to fostering diversity within the data services profession. I will discuss interns' experiences, including their acquisition of valuable skills and introduction into the data librarian community. Nevertheless, I will also candidly acknowledge that no program is without its challenges. Therefore, I will address the obstacles faced within the program, such as building a sense of community in remote work settings, managing limited time, and addressing site onboarding complexities.<br /><br /><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> <ul class="vertical-list"><li>By sharing insights, experiences, and lessons learned the talk aims to inspire continued efforts in creating inclusive and equitable opportunities for aspiring data professionals from underrepresented backgrounds particularly in the context of recent scrutiny of diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives nationally. This talk also aims to be informative for those interested in participating in such a program or creating similar programs. </ul></div>

We queried two user groups: researchers who have completed a data publication via QDR and researchers who have started deposits, but whose project has not yet been published. With the help of both groups' answers, we aim to address two questions: 1) how do researchers judge the value of services provided by QDR and 2) what are the major obstacles and pain points experienced by researchers attempting to share qualitative data. We base our questionnaire in large part on a protocol developed by the Data Curation Network, and so add to scholarship on the value of curation more generally, with a comparative lens specifically trained on qualitative social scientists. In this short presentation, we discuss our methodological approach and some lessons learned for surveying this researcher population, as well as present summary analyses of the qualitative and quantitative portions of the survey. We draw lessons from the experiences provided by the depositors who achieved data publication, to provide insights that data librarians â€” a key liaison between researchers and repositories â€” can apply to assist future candidates for qualitative data publication.<br /><br /><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> <ul class="vertical-list"><li>Data librarians will learn what factors have assisted qualitative social scientists with completing a data publication. <li>Attendees will identify what factors have challenged qualitative social scientists when depositing data. <li>Attendees will receive general good-practice recommendations about curation services based on researchersâ€™ experience with QDR.</ul></div>
