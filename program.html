At our library, we decided to use a unique and collaborative approach that brought together undergraduate data fellows, student employees from the library's Engagement and Marketing teams, and full-time library staff to plan the library's annual Love Data Week event. This presentation will showcase how the teams were able to combine their collective expertise to design an engaging, student-focused, week-long event that promoted the library's research data services to the campus community. We will discuss the development of a cross-divisional marketing strategy involving social media, newsletters, and email reminders. We will also discuss the development of activities, data-themed games and prizes, and an engaging display for tabling events at two campus libraries. We'll conclude by sharing lessons learned and strategies for all data librarians to collaborate across boundaries in promoting their services.<br /><br /><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> <ul class="vertical-list"><li>1) Understand the benefits of collaborative approaches in promoting research data services to students; <li>2) Explore effective strategies for engaging students through events like Love Data Week utilizing cross-divisional collaboration and marketing tactics; <li>3) Examine the integral role of student data fellows and library employees in the planning and execution of data-themed library events gaining insights into how their involvement contributes to the success of student-focused data promotion initiatives</ul></div>

Smaller staff size, a deeper focus on undergraduate education, and an absence of large-scale research infrastructure all contribute to the lack of data management services. However, the need for these services exists at smaller institutions as well, with researchers often navigating complicated data management concerns themselves. Libraries can provide a framework to remedy these issues. <br /><br /> This session will detail the implementation of data management services at a mid-sized comprehensive institution due to administrative and faculty requests, in combination with a multi-year effort to increase the institution's research profile. The presenters will discuss how they developed a plan for data management services. They will also discuss the development of resources based on faculty input, including an extensive guide for data management and the rollout of individual consultations with faculty.<br /><br /><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> <ul class="vertical-list"><li>Attendees will understand the elements required to implement data management services at smaller institutions. <li>Attendees will recognize potential areas for assessment and planning to implement in their own data management services.</ul></div></td></tr>

Markets are all about consumer and business data (activities and trends) tied to locations. Geospatial literacy is a fundamental skill for anyone engaged in business, yet it is often absent in business curricula. At the same time, the ubiquity of GIS applications and more accessible geospatial tools (hardware and software) allow GIS specialists to collaborate productively with other disciplines. Is this a missed opportunity you are seeing at your organization? This poster will help you make the case for integrating geospatial literacy into business curricula through specific market intelligence use cases. It provides a framework for thinking about GIS data in business contexts; a summary of applications, data sources (free and subscription) and their relevance to specific use cases; and a sample lesson plan based on sessions delivered with graduate business students at Vanderbilt University.<br /><br /><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> <ul class="vertical-list"><li>1) Specific use cases for incorporating geospatial data literacy into business curricula; <li>2) sample lesson plan for GIS data or business librarians to start engaging business students and faculty; <li>3) understanding of relevant GIS and business data sources used in industry and academia (including their scope, strengths and weaknesses).</ul></div>

We recently redesigned Python Camp to emphasize principles of inclusive pedagogy, aiming specifically to reach learners who don't consider themselves programmers or may have struggled to learn programming in the past. Our new curriculum is grounded in collaborative practice, allowing participants to work together to solve problems with code using a "real-world" dataset, and centering the agency of learners, who on the fourth day of Camp are invited to design their own culminating project. Throughout the Camp, we incorporate activities intended to foster practices of computational thinking: e.g., asking questions about code, developing user stories to guide development, understanding the logic of code as distinct from its syntax. Our redesigned Python Camp has been impactful for both learners and instructors, and we are eager to share our experience with others who are interested in inclusive pedagogy, teaching code in libraries, and related topics.<br /><br /><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> <ul class="vertical-list"><li>1) Practice identifying and reflecting on biases that may affect our teaching. <li>2) Explore ways to present computational topics in ways that accommodate learners from diverse backgrounds. <li>3) Practice strategies for making such topics more accessible to beginners by reducing cognitive load, scaffolding,and encouraging active learning.</ul></div>

This demand is further driven by researchers' requests for data literacy instruction. While LIS curricular offerings and professional workshops provide venues for LIS students as well as early mid-career professionals to gain skills, challenges still exist for those seeking to advance their skills and knowledge and for administrators seeking to support their staff in professional development, while also running a library. The LEADS Program, the succeeding LEADING Program, and DataLIS have helped us to better understand current obstacles and provide insight into how we might address these challenges. This presentation will provide an overview of LEADING's inception and evolution to inspire others to engage in similar work addressing data science professional development needs of information professionals, and how what we've learned may help professional development efforts across other areas.

Specifically, we will share quantitative results from an online survey of 200 purposefully recruited respondents representing 12 social science disciplines, asking about their familiarity with and propensity to use resources and techniques that might enable better data management, as well as appropriate sharing of sensitive data (ex: data use agreements, virtual enclaves, etc.). We will also discuss common themes in respondents' free-text answers to a question about how they personally define research data sensitivity. We highlight common challenges researchers perceive in planning for data sharing of what they consider to be sensitive data, which is of relevance to the work of research data librarians. Relatedly, the presentation also highlights possible avenues for both general assistance and project-tailored guidance which data librarians are well-poised to offer.<br /><br /><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> <ul class="vertical-list"><li>1. Learn about variations in the perceptions of scholars from several social, health, environmental and other related disciplines of the possibility of sharing potentially sensitive data; <li>2. Appreciate the wide range of interpretations researchers hold of what constitutes "sensitive" research data ; <li>3.

	<p><em>Keynote Title:</em> Big Data Projects at the NIH: Report from an NIH DATA Scholar</p>
 
<p><em>Abstract:</em> Access to large, diverse datasets is key for the development of AI models in biomedicine. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) recognizes this need and has several ongoing efforts to increase access to data for researchers: establishing data generation projects such as Bridge2AI and All of Us, promoting access to observational health data stored in electronic health records, and encouraging data sharing. All of these efforts require data standardization, which is currently an important focus of the NIH; common data models and common data elements (CDEs) are a few example approaches for improving data standardization and data sharing.</p>
 
<p>The NIH started the Data and Technology Advancement (DATA) National Service Scholar Program in 2020 to help with large data science projects across the NIH. I served as a DATA Scholar at the National Eye Institute from 2022 – 2024, focusing on standardizing ocular observational health data into the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model. This talk will discuss my DATA scholar project within the larger context of data science and standardization projects at the NIH.</p>
 
<p><em>Bio:</em> Dr. Michelle R. Hribar, PhD is an Associate Professor of Ophthalmology and Medical Informatics at Oregon Health & Science University. She was also very recently an NIH DATA Scholar at the National Eye Institute (NEI) where she worked in the Office of Data Science and Health Informatics. She is currently leading a national effort to improve the standardization of ophthalmic data for research, which includes co-chairing the Observational Health and Data Science Informatics (OHDSI) Eye Care and Vision Research workgroup with the goal of adding ophthalmic data to the OMOP common data model. Dr. Hribar originally trained as a computer scientist before retraining as a medical informaticist at Oregon Health & Science University. Her NIH grant funded research has focused exclusively on informatics in ophthalmology, specifically in the reuse of electronic health record data for research both in operations and clinical applications.
